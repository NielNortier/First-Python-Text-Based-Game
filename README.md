# Development First-Python-Text-Based-Game

This is the first ever python program I created. Back when the pandemic just started I created this text based game to learn more about python syntax. I will be using this program as part of a CMPG323 homework assignment to demonstrate git knowledge. This python script was origanally created on my iPad with pythonista. I have since moved it to my desktop and updated it to use python 3.7.

## This is a text based game

This is a text based game. The aim of the game is to defeat the witch and lift the curse. It contains questionable logic but helped me to understand the basics of python.
